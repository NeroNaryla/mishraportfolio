                        I am a 19 year old Undergraduate Student in Queen Mary University's of London studying Computer science.</br>
                        Computer science has been something I have been passionate about since I was young. I am excited to overcome</br> 
                        challenges that will push me to grow via applying learned skills to create real impacts. I revel in solving </br>
                        expanding my knowledge and completing tough challenges, such as coding competitions, hackathons, game jams and more.</br>
                         My strong desire to experiment with computer science since I was 10, curiously figuring out how a coding website I</br>
                          came across, which sparked me to collaborate to conceptualise and explore innovating new programmes and design projects.</br>

                    Since this is my portfolio, there are various hobbies and projects I feel like I should add since I like bringing them up.</br>
                    The main hobbies I have relating to my studies of computer science are my interest in game development and coding competitions.</br>
                    As of now there are 2 main games I am developing, a top down 2d mobile game on Godot, as well as a First Person Horror on Unreal</br>
                    Engine 5. My previous projects include an asteroid like game as well as a dungeon crawler made with Unity.</br>
                    I greatly enjoy pushing myself and as such I have taken part in various coding competitions, most of them being on CodeChef.</br>
                    It is a very thrilling and difficult experience where we have to compete and create the best code in a short amount of time</br>
                    which is very similar gamejams I have been a part of. However, unlike gamejams, you can not make teams or collaborate with others.</br>
                    
                    I also have various other hobbies, one of which is learning languages, which has let me become very profficient in Spanish.</br>
                    Other ones include creating masks/art, drawing, video editing, writing in general and some video production, all to varying degrees.</br>
